"""
Lightbulb class definition for RandomWalks scene from hamming-codes-2.

Based on investigation, Lightbulb appears to be an SVGMobject that was likely
part of the original manimlib but not included in the public repositories.

This implementation provides a simple Lightbulb class that should work for
the RandomWalks scene where it's used with:
    bulb = Lightbulb()
    bulb.next_to(idea_dot, UP)

# Notes on usage in RandomWalks scene:
# - The Lightbulb is positioned next to an "idea_dot" at coordinates (10, 3)
# - It represents the target/goal of the random walk search
# - The scene shows multiple paths searching for this "idea"
# - When a path reaches the idea spot, it likely triggers some visual effect
