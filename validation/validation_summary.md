# Validation Test Summary

## Test Results

The validation framework has been successfully set up and tested with the "inventing-math" video from 2015.

### What Works âœ…

1. **File Matching Phase**
   - Claude correctly identifies `inventing_math.py` as the primary file
   - Confidence score: 0.98 (exceeds threshold of 0.8)
   - Evidence: 11 detailed pieces linking code to transcript
   - Output file created at correct location: `output/v5/2015/inventing-math/matches.json`

2. **Evidence Quality**
   - Exact constant matches: `DIVERGENT_SUM_TEXT` and `CONVERGENT_SUM_TEXT`
   - Scene class correlations with transcript content
   - File naming patterns recognized
   - Supporting files identified

3. **Verbose Output**
   - `--verbose` flag shows Claude's reasoning in real-time
   - Helps debug and monitor the matching process

### Known Issues

1. **Timeouts**: The full test may timeout during the cleaning phase (5-minute limit)
2. **Path handling**: Fixed by using absolute paths in prompts

### Usage

```bash
# Run validation test (verbose mode automatic)
python scripts/test_claude_matcher.py

# Run full matcher with verbose output
python scripts/claude_match_videos.py --verbose

# Run for specific year
python scripts/claude_match_videos.py --year 2016 --verbose
```

### Next Steps

1. Consider increasing timeout for cleaning phase
2. Add option to skip cleaning phase during testing
3. Run on full 2015 dataset to generate complete mappings
