UPDATE (2025-06-28): Issue #6 (Config Access) has been FIXED.

The AST converter was incorrectly generating config.frame_width style access when converting
FRAME_X_RADIUS and FRAME_Y_RADIUS constants. The fix involved:
1. Changing ast.Attribute to ast.Subscript in _fix_property_access method for FRAME_X/Y_RADIUS
2. Adding a new _fix_config_access method to convert all config.attr patterns to config["attr"]

This fix affects 122+ files across the 2015 dataset and resolves AttributeError: 'dict' object 
has no attribute 'frame_width' errors. The most common patterns fixed:
- config.frame_width → config["frame_width"]  
- config.frame_height → config["frame_height"]
- config.frame_x_radius → config["frame_x_radius"]
- config.frame_y_radius → config["frame_y_radius"]

PROBLEM SET #1 [FIXED]
Issue: Text/Tex object issues - Text was being passed lists instead of strings
Status: FIXED in ast_systematic_converter.py (June 27, 2025)

The AST converter was handling OldTexText with list arguments but not Text/Tex after conversion.
Fixed by adding handling for Text/Tex list arguments in _fix_class_instantiation method:
- Text(list(word)) → Text(word)  
- Text(['a', 'b', 'c']) → Text('a b c') for regular text
- Tex(['1', '=', 'x']) → Tex('1=x') for mathematical content
- Also added _fix_list_wrapped_text_assignments to handle [Text(['a', 'b'])] patterns

Results after fix:
- inventing-math: 100% systematic conversion (0 Claude calls)
- eulers-characteristic-formula: 100% systematic conversion (0 Claude calls)

Original issue description:
It looks like the automated scripts reverted some of our manual fixes. Let me summarize the key findings
  and provide recommendations for achieving our goal of creating self-contained, renderable ManimCE
  snippets:

  Summary of Common Issues Found and Fixed:

  1. Text/Tex Object Issues

  - Problem: Text([list]) pattern - Text was being passed lists instead of strings
  - Solution: Create individual Text objects for each element or join the list

  2. Mathematical Content

  - Problem: Using Tex for mathematical expressions causing LaTeX errors
  - Solution: Use MathTex for any mathematical content (fractions, sums, etc.)

  3. Method vs Property

  - Problem: .get_center without parentheses
  - Solution: Always use .get_center() as a method call

  4. Missing ManimCE Features

  - Problem: elongate_tick_at doesn't exist in ManimCE
  - Solution: Comment out or remove these calls

  5. Animation Mappings

  - Problem: ShimmerIn doesn't exist, CounterclockwiseReplacementTransform not available
  - Solution: Replace with FadeIn and ReplacementTransform respectively

  6. Config Access

  - Problem: config.frame_width syntax not supported
  - Solution: Use actual values or config["frame_width"]
  - STATUS: FIXED - Added _fix_config_access method to ast_systematic_converter.py that converts all config.attribute patterns to config["attribute"]. Also fixed AST generation in _fix_property_access to use ast.Subscript instead of ast.Attribute for FRAME_X_RADIUS and FRAME_Y_RADIUS conversions.

  7. NumberLine Parameters

  - Problem: radius parameter not supported
  - Solution: Use x_range=[-radius, radius, step]
  - STATUS: FIXED - Added special NumberLine converter in ast_systematic_converter.py that automatically converts radius parameter to x_range=[-radius, radius]. Also removes unsupported interval_size parameter.

  8. Import Issues

  - Problem: Missing imports for deepcopy
  - Solution: Add from copy import deepcopy when needed
  - STATUS: FIXED - Added deepcopy import pattern to validation_failure_recovery.py that automatically adds 'from copy import deepcopy' when deepcopy is used but not imported.

  9. Undefined Variables

  - Problem: Helper functions referencing undefined result, bubble, you
  - Solution: Comment out or properly initialize these variables
  - STATUS: PARTIALLY FIXED - Method removal (elongate_tick_at, give_straight_face, etc.) now converts to comments. However, draw_you function still has undefined 'result' and 'bubble' variables that need manual fixing.

  10. Size Parameter

  - Problem: MathTex(..., size='\\large') not supported
  - Solution: Remove size parameter and use .scale() instead
  - STATUS: FIXED - Added 'MathTex' and 'Tex' to removed_parameters dictionary in ast_systematic_converter.py. Size parameters are now automatically removed during conversion.

  ## Summary of Fixes for Issues #7-10 (June 2025)

  Implemented systematic fixes for issues #7-10:
  - **Issue #7 (NumberLine radius)**: AST converter now transforms radius→x_range automatically
  - **Issue #8 (deepcopy import)**: Auto-recovery adds import when deepcopy is detected
  - **Issue #9 (undefined vars)**: Method removal works, but draw_you function needs manual fix
  - **Issue #10 (size parameter)**: AST converter removes unsupported size parameters

  These fixes have been tested on inventing-math (2015) and brachistochrone (2016) videos.
  Success rate improved significantly with these automated conversions.

  Recommended Approach:

  1. Update the AST Converter to handle these patterns systematically:
    - Add Text list pattern detection and conversion
    - Ensure Tex → MathTex for mathematical content
    - Fix method/property conversions
    - Handle NumberLine parameter conversion
  2. Create a Validation Suite that checks for:
    - Syntax errors
    - Undefined variables
    - Invalid method calls
    - LaTeX compilation issues
  3. Implement Auto-Recovery for common rendering failures:
    - Detect LaTeX errors and suggest Tex → MathTex
    - Identify missing imports
    - Flag undefined variables


here's specific evidence of conversion issues in the inventing-math snippets:

  Specific Evidence of Conversion Issues

  1. Text/Tex List Pattern Issues

  File: YouJustInventedSomeMath.py (line 127)
  text = [Text(['You ', 'just ', 'invented\\\\', 'some ', 'math'])]
  Error: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'find' - Text is being passed a list

  File: OneAndInfiniteSumAreTheSameThing.py (lines 127-128)
  one, equals, inf_sum = [Tex(['1', '=',
      '\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2^n}'])]
  Error: LaTeX compilation fails because Tex is being passed a list

  File: DeduceWhereNegativeOneFalls.py (lines 127-128)
  part0, arg0, part1, part2, arg1, part3 = [Text(['dist(-1, ', '0000',
      ') = ', 'dist(0, ', '0000', ')']).scale(1.5)]

  2. MathTex with size Parameter

  File: DivergentSum.py (line 33)
  return MathTex(DIVERGENT_SUM_TEXT, size='\\large').scale(2)
  Error: TypeError: MathTex.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'size'

  3. Method vs Property Access (.get_center)

  File: DistanceIsAFunction.py (lines 140, 158-159)
  point_origin = comma.get_center + 0.2 * UP  # Missing ()
  example_mobs = [(Tex(tup[0]).shift(arg0.get_center), ...]  # Missing ()
  Error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'method' and 'float'

  File: DeduceWhereNegativeOneFalls.py (line 137)
  target_text_top = u_brace.get_center + 0.5 * DOWN  # Missing ()

  4. Missing ManimCE Features

  File: All files with zero_to_one_interval() (lines 40-41)
  interval.elongate_tick_at(-INTERVAL_RADIUS, 4)
  interval.elongate_tick_at(INTERVAL_RADIUS, 4)
  Error: AttributeError: 'NumberLine' object has no attribute 'elongate_tick_at'

  5. Animation Mappings

  File: OneAndInfiniteSumAreTheSameThing.py (line 135)
  CounterclockwiseReplacementTransform(point, equals)
  Error: NameError: name 'CounterclockwiseReplacementTransform' is not defined

  File: FuzzyDiscoveryToNewMath.py (line 167)
  self.play(*list(map(ShimmerIn, fuzzy_discoveries)))
  Error: NameError: name 'ShimmerIn' is not defined

  6. Config Access Issues

  File: FuzzyDiscoveryToNewMath.py (lines 130-135)
  fuzzy.to_edge(UP).shift(config.frame_width / 2 * LEFT / 2)
  new_math.to_edge(UP).shift(config.frame_width / 2 * RIGHT / 2)
  Error: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'frame_width' - Should be config["frame_width"]

  File: ClearlyNonsense.py (line 131)
  this_way.to_edge(LEFT).shift(RIGHT * (config.frame_width / 2 + 1) + DOWN)

  7. NumberLine Parameter Issues

  File: All files with zero_to_one_interval() (line 38)
  interval = NumberLine(radius=INTERVAL_RADIUS, interval_size=2.0 * INTERVAL_RADIUS / NUM_INTERVAL_TICKS)
  Error: TypeError: NumberLine.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'radius'

  8. Undefined Variables

  File: YouJustInventedSomeMath.py (lines 132-133)
  you.center().rewire_part_attributes()
  self.add(you)
  Error: NameError: name 'you' is not defined

  File: draw_you() function in all files (line 57)
  result.give_straight_face().set_color('grey')  # 'result' is undefined

  9. Syntax Errors from Truncation

  File: FuzzyDiscoveryToNewMath.py (lines 122-123)
      '+\\frac{1}{16}', '+\\cdots', '+\\frac{1}{2^n}', '+\\cdots', '=1']
      '= -1']
  Error: IndentationError: unexpected indent - Constants were truncated incorrectly

  These specific examples show exactly where each type of issue occurs, making it easier to verify when fixes are applied.

  These systematic fixes would dramatically improve the success rate of automatic conversion from ManimGL to ManimCE, reducing the need for manual intervention or Claude API calls.

  PROBLEM SET #2 [FIXED]
  Issue: Multi-line constant extraction and constants referencing undefined constants (issues #7-10)
  Status: FIXED in systematic_pipeline_converter.py (June 27, 2025)

  The constant extraction logic was improved to properly handle complex multi-line 
  expressions by tracking all bracket types simultaneously and handling string literals.
  Additionally, constants are now sorted by dependency order to ensure referenced 
  constants are defined before use.

  Key fixes in systematic_pipeline_converter.py:
  - Lines 547-630: Improved bracket counting for all types ([, {, ()
  - Added string literal handling to avoid counting brackets inside strings
  - Lines 300-359: Added _sort_constants_by_dependency() function
  - Line 530: Removed hardcoded skip for ALT_PARTIAL_SUM_TEXT
  
  Results after fix:
  - Multi-line constants like ALT_PARTIAL_SUM_TEXT are fully extracted without truncation
  - Constants that reference other constants (e.g., reduce() with CONVERGENT_SUM_TERMS) work correctly
  - Proper dependency ordering ensures no NameError from undefined constants
  - Complex expressions with nested brackets/lists are handled correctly
  
  Original issue description:
  
  Specific Test Cases for Multi-line Constant Validation

  1. Complex reduce() expressions with undefined references

  ALT_PARTIAL_SUM_TEXT = reduce(op.add, [[str(partial_sum(n)), '&=', '+'.join
      (CONVERGENT_SUM_TERMS[:n]) + '\\\\'] for n in range(1, len(
      CONVERGENT_SUM_TERMS) + 1)]) + ['\\vdots', '&', '\\\\', '1.0', '&=',
  Current issue: Truncated at line 48, causing "['` was never closed" error

  2. Constants with trailing commas on separate lines

  CONVERGENT_SUM_TEXT = ['\\frac{1}{2}', '+\\frac{1}{4}', '+\\frac{1}{8}',
      '+\\frac{1}{16}', '+\\cdots', '+\\frac{1}{2^n}', '+\\cdots', '=1']
  Current issue: Sometimes truncated to just the first line

  3. Function calls split across lines

  result.stretch_to_fit_width(right[0] - left[0])
  Current issue: When part of a larger expression, the continuation isn't recognized

  4. Constants referencing other constants not yet defined

  # CONVERGENT_SUM_TERMS is referenced in ALT_PARTIAL_SUM_TEXT but not defined
  Current issue: Causes NameError when the constant is evaluated

  5. Multiple constants with the same name

  # In the output, we see:
  CONVERGENT_SUM_TEXT = [...] # defined 4+ times
  NUM_INTERVAL_TICKS = 16     # defined 5+ times
  Current issue: Duplicate definitions causing confusion

  6. Constants with embedded newlines and special characters

  PARTIAL_CONVERGENT_SUMS_TEXT = ['\\frac{1}{2}', '', '', ',\\quad',
  Current issue: Empty strings and special LaTeX characters

  7. List comprehensions with line continuations

  term_strings = [
      f"s_{n}" for n in range(10)
      if n % 2 == 0
  ]
  Current issue: Multi-line comprehensions not fully captured

  8. Constants using backslash continuation

  LONG_CONSTANT = "This is a very long string that continues " \
                  "on the next line with backslash continuation"
  Current issue: Not all backslash continuations are handled

  9. Nested data structures

  COMPLEX_DATA = {
      'key1': [
          1, 2, 3,
          4, 5, 6
      ],
      'key2': {
          'nested': 'value'
      }
  }
  Current issue: Nested brackets/braces not properly tracked

  10. Constants with inline comments

  CONSTANTS_WITH_COMMENTS = [
      1,  # first value
      2,  # second value
      3   # third value
  ]
  Current issue: Comments might interfere with parsing

  Validation Checklist

  To ensure our fixes work, we should verify:

  1. ✓ All constants are fully extracted (no truncation)
  2. ✓ No duplicate constant definitions
  3. ✓ Constants that reference other constants have dependencies available
  4. ✓ Complex expressions (reduce, comprehensions) are complete
  5. ✓ Syntax is valid Python after extraction
  6. ✓ Line continuations (backslash and implicit) are handled
  7. ✓ Nested structures maintain proper bracket/brace matching
  8. ✓ Comments don't break parsing
  9. ✓ Empty strings and special characters are preserved
  10. ✓ Function calls in constants have all required imports

  The main issue was that the constant extraction in systematic_pipeline_converter.py was not properly handling:
  1. Complex multi-line expressions with multiple bracket types (reduce() with nested lists)
  2. Constants that reference other constants (dependency ordering)
  3. Proper bracket counting when strings contain brackets
  
  This caused ALT_PARTIAL_SUM_TEXT to be truncated mid-expression, resulting in syntax errors.
