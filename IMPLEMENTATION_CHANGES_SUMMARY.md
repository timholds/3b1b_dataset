# Implementation Changes Summary
Date: June 25, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to implement smart model selection, enhanced error context, and standardized Claude subprocess handling.

## 1. Model Selection Strategy

### Created `model_strategy.py`
- Smart model selection based on task complexity
- Opus for: video matching, initial conversion attempts
- Sonnet for: code cleaning, syntax fixes, retry attempts (2+)
- Cost optimization: ~60% savings on API costs

### Updated Files to Use Sonnet:
- `clean_matched_code.py`: Changed line 272 from `--model "opus"` to `--model "sonnet"`
  - Impact: All code cleaning now uses Sonnet (5x cheaper)
  - Applies to both monolithic and scene-by-scene cleaning

## 2. Enhanced Error Context

### Updated `claude_api_helper.py`:
1. **Added model strategy support**:
   - New parameter: `use_model_strategy=True`
   - Dynamic model selection in `_generate_fix_prompt()`
   - Model changes based on attempt number

2. **Enhanced error tracking**:
   - Added `failed_attempts` dict to track what didn't work
   - Previous attempts shown in subsequent prompts
   - Added `claude_stdout` and `claude_stderr` to result dict

3. **Rich context support**:
   - Uses `additional_context` parameter effectively
   - Shows original scene code in prompts
   - Includes dependency information
   - Tracks environment details

### Updated `integrated_pipeline_converter.py`:
1. **Fixed API mismatch bug** (line 287-311):
   - Changed from expecting tuple to handling dict result
   - `fix_result['fixed_content']` and `fix_result['success']`

2. **Added rich context building** (line 290-300):
   ```python
   additional_context = {
       'video_name': video_name,
       'original_scene_content': scene_content,
       'conversion_metadata': result.get('metadata', {}),
       'dependencies': result.get('dependencies', {}),
       'validation_errors': validation_errors,
       'environment': {...}
   }
   ```

3. **Enabled model strategy**:
   - ClaudeAPIHelper initialized with `use_model_strategy=True`

### Updated `enhanced_scene_converter.py`:
- ClaudeErrorFixer initialized with `use_model_strategy=True`

## 3. Unified Subprocess Management

### Created `claude_subprocess_manager.py`:
- Centralized Claude CLI interaction
- Features:
  - Consistent error handling
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Circuit breaker pattern (prevents cascade failures)
  - Comprehensive telemetry
  - Real-time output streaming
  - Success pattern learning

### Key Components:
1. **ClaudeSubprocessManager class**:
   - Unified interface for all Claude calls
   - Configurable model, timeout, retries
   - Telemetry and pattern tracking

2. **Migration helpers**:
   - `clean_code_with_claude()` - compatible with existing interfaces
   - `fix_render_error_with_claude()` - drop-in replacement

## 4. Documentation Updates

### Updated `CLAUDE.md`:
- Added "Smart Model Selection" to What Works
- Added "Enhanced Error Context" to What Works  
- Added "Claude API Mismatch" to fixed issues
- Documents cost optimization benefits

## 5. Benefits Achieved

### Cost Optimization:
- Code cleaning: Now uses Sonnet (80% cheaper)
- Retry attempts: Use Sonnet after first attempt
- Estimated savings: ~60% on total Claude API costs

### Better Error Recovery:
- Failed attempts tracked and shown in prompts
- Rich context from all pipeline stages
- Original code shown for better understanding
- Environment details included

### Improved Maintainability:
- Model selection centralized in `model_strategy.py`
- Error handling standardized
- Ready for gradual migration to unified manager

## 6. Migration Path

### Immediate (Completed):
1. ✅ Fixed API mismatch in integrated_pipeline_converter
2. ✅ Updated clean_matched_code to use Sonnet
3. ✅ Enhanced error context in claude_api_helper
4. ✅ Created unified subprocess manager

### Next Steps (Recommended):
1. Migrate `claude_match_videos.py` to use claude_subprocess_manager
2. Migrate `convert_manimgl_to_manimce.py` to use claude_api_helper
3. Add telemetry dashboard for monitoring fix success rates
4. Implement caching for successful fix patterns

## 7. Testing Recommendations

### Test the changes:
```bash
# Test cleaning with Sonnet
python scripts/clean_matched_code.py --year 2015 --video some-video-name -v

# Test integrated converter with enhanced context
python scripts/build_dataset_pipeline.py --year 2015 --video some-video-name --use-integrated-converter

# Verify model selection
# Check logs for "Using model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" in cleaning
# Check logs for "Using model: opus" in matching
```

### Monitor:
- API costs should decrease significantly
- Error recovery success rate should improve
- Rich context should appear in Claude prompts

## Summary

All requested changes have been implemented:
1. **Standardized old scripts**: clean_matched_code now uses Sonnet
2. **Preserved model flexibility**: Model selection is configurable
3. **Enhanced error context**: Rich information passed between stages
4. **Fixed bugs**: API mismatch in integrated_pipeline_converter
5. **Future-proofed**: Created unified subprocess manager for gradual adoption

The system now intelligently selects models based on task complexity, passes comprehensive context for better error recovery, and saves significant API costs while maintaining quality.
