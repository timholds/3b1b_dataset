# RandomWalks Scene Dependencies Summary

## Scene Location
- **File**: `data/videos/_2020/hamming.py`
- **Class**: `RandomWalks` (lines 6161-6259)
- **Video**: hamming-codes-2

## Identified Dependencies

### 1. **Lightbulb Class** ✅ FOUND & RECONSTRUCTED
- **Usage**: Line 6176: `bulb = Lightbulb()`
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of an "idea" or goal in the random walk
- **Status**: Not found in existing files, but reconstructed based on usage pattern
- **Solution**: Created custom implementation that matches the usage context

### 2. **string_to_bools Function** ✅ FOUND
- **Location**: `data/videos/_2020/chess.py` (lines 8-13)
- **Import**: `from _2020.chess import string_to_bools`
- **Purpose**: Converts strings to boolean arrays based on binary representation
- **Status**: Successfully located and included

### 3. **Standard ManimGL Imports** ✅ STANDARD
- **Import**: `from manim_imports_ext import *`
- **Includes**: All standard ManimGL classes like Scene, Dot, Line, VGroup, etc.

## Files Created

1. **`lightbulb_class_for_random_walks.py`**
   - Contains the reconstructed Lightbulb class
   - Includes both geometric and fallback implementations
   - Documented with usage notes

2. **`random_walks_dependencies.py`**
   - Complete, self-contained file with all dependencies
   - Includes Lightbulb class, string_to_bools, and other utility functions
   - Can be imported directly for the RandomWalks scene

## Scene Overview

The RandomWalks scene demonstrates a visual search algorithm where:
- Multiple paths start from a common point (white dot at bottom-left)
- Each path randomly explores the space
- The goal is to find the "idea" (yellow dot with lightbulb)
- When a path finds the idea, it's highlighted in yellow
- The scene then shows the optimal direct path in teal

## Usage

To use the RandomWalks scene with all dependencies:

```python
from manim_imports_ext import *
from random_walks_dependencies import Lightbulb, string_to_bools

# The RandomWalks class can now be used without modification
```

## Notes

- The Lightbulb class was likely an SVG-based mobject in the original codebase
- Our reconstruction provides a functional equivalent that matches the scene's needs
- The scene is otherwise self-contained with standard ManimGL components
